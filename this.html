    <p>--This one's for us</p>
    <p>
        When was the last time you built something just cause it's fun?
        Something that doesn't and shouldn't turn out to be this fancy side
        project of yours that's gonna turn into a startup.. but rather just
        because is fun? Deep down amongst that huge pile of corporate garbage,
        scrum bullshit procedures, daily standups and lately uneducated managers
        pushing the AI buzz word down your trought... amongst all of that shit,
        is that fire that got you into the programming still alive?
